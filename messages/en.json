    "editorialPara2": "Within a 10-mile stretch of coastline, you have six genuine links courses ranging from Royal Birkdale (consistently top five in the world) to Southport Old Links (genuinely good golf for £40). You can play a different course every day for a week and not cover the same ground twice — and the variety is striking. Birkdale through dramatic willow scrub dunes. Hillside through ridge-and-valley terrain. Formby through coastal pinewoods. West Lancashire with raw Irish Sea exposure.",
    "editorialPara3": "The practical case for the Sefton Coast over Scotland is simple: it's easier to get to from mainland Europe and North America via Liverpool and Manchester airports, the accommodation is better value, and the courses are more accessible to visitors than their Scottish counterparts at the same quality tier. Royal Birkdale is cheaper than Muirfield and easier to book.",
    "editorialPara4": "And in July 2026, the world will be watching. The Open Championship returns to Royal Birkdale — the venue that gave us Spieth's miraculous escape from the drop zone in 2017, Watson's clinical 1983 win, and the 1969 Ryder Cup concession that defined sportsmanship in golf. If you've ever thought about a links golf trip to England, now is the time.",

    "aboutPara1": "The Open Championship — the oldest Major in golf and the only one played outside North America — returns to Royal Birkdale for the 11th time in July 2026. No other venue on the Open rota has hosted more frequently, a record that reflects both the quality of the course and its exceptional logistical suitability for a major championship.",
    "aboutPara2": "Royal Birkdale is a links in the truest sense. Fairways run between towering sand dunes that funnel the coastal wind in unpredictable ways. The willow scrub rough — a Birkdale signature — is punishing but navigable. Greens are small, fast and subtly contoured. Championship conditions produce scoring that typically ends around level par or better for the winner, but only when the weather cooperates. When it doesn't, Birkdale becomes one of the most demanding tests in world golf.",
    "aboutPara3": "The 2017 Open delivered one of the most dramatic finishes in recent memory. Jordan Spieth, leading wire-to-wire, made a triple bogey on 13 after pulling his tee shot into an area containing TV equipment. His subsequent decision to take relief under the drop zone rule — combined with a remarkable pitch to within feet of the hole — became one of the defining images of modern Major championship golf.",
    "aboutPara4": "For golf tourists, The Open at Royal Birkdale represents a unique opportunity: the world's most prestigious golf event, at one of England's greatest links courses, in a compact and accessible setting. Spectator access throughout the course is excellent, the atmosphere is distinctly British, and the food and entertainment village has improved considerably in recent editions.",

    "howToPlanPara2": "For multi-day trips, base yourself in Southport. The town has the widest hotel choice, and everything from Lord Street to Birkdale is within taxi distance. If you want quieter and cheaper accommodation, Formby village is 20 minutes south and has decent B&B options.",
    "howToPlanPara3": "The order matters. Don't play Royal Birkdale first — you'll spend the rest of the trip comparing everything to it. Build up: start with Old Links or S&A, move to Hillside on day two, arrive at Birkdale when you've found your links legs. The contrast will make the finale feel earned.",
    "howToPlanPara4": "Book tee times before you arrive. Royal Birkdale fills weeks ahead, Hillside two to four weeks, S&A and Old Links you can often get on a week out. Formby requires advance contact with the club secretary — there's no online booking."

    "aboutLinksPara1": "Links golf conditions are fundamentally different from parkland golf. The key variables are wind direction and strength, recent rainfall and drainage, and the firmness of the turf. A firm, dry course plays completely differently to a wet, soft one — approach shots don't stop, the ball runs further off the tee, and chipping becomes more creative.",
    "aboutLinksPara2": "The Sefton Coast courses drain well by design — they're built on sand. Even after heavy rain, Royal Birkdale and Hillside typically recover faster than inland courses. Southport & Ainsdale and West Lancashire can hold water slightly longer due to their terrain. Formby's woodland sections dry quickest.",
    "aboutLinksPara3": "Wind speed and direction matter more here than almost anywhere in England. The prevailing south-westerly at Royal Birkdale creates the 'natural' course experience the routing was designed for. An easterly off the land produces a completely different course. This guide includes a wind direction key for Royal Birkdale specifically.",

      "description": "Royal Birkdale is the greatest links course most golfers will ever play. Set among towering sand dunes on the Sefton Coast, it has hosted ten Open Championships and ranks consistently among the top five courses in the world. The 2026 Open returns here in July — and if you're planning a golf trip to the Sefton Coast, this is the reason.\n\nThe course demands creativity and intelligence. Fairways run between steep dunes that channel the wind in unpredictable ways. The rough is brutal. Greens are fast, subtle and positioned to make you think about every approach. It's not a course you muscle your way around — links experience helps enormously.\n\nVisitor tee times are available, but Royal Birkdale is strict about both availability and etiquette. Pre-book well in advance, respect the dress code, and play to your handicap certificate requirement.",

Immediately adjacent to Royal Birkdale, it shares the same dramatic duneland but offers significantly better visitor access at a fraction of the green fee. Golf professionals who play both courses often rate Hillside's back nine among the finest in England.\n\nThe course underwent significant redevelopment on its final nine holes, which now run through spectacular ridge-and-valley terrain through the dunes. The routing is logical and the course condition is consistently excellent. If you're building a multi-day itinerary, Hillside the day before Royal Birkdale is a near-perfect combination.",

Set through coastal pinewoods with stretches of pure heathland links, it's a fundamentally different experience to Royal Birkdale or Hillside. The pines offer shelter and a distinctive visual character, while the dune sections are as challenging as anything on the coast. If you can get on, do.\n\nNote: Formby Golf Club is a men-only club. Formby Ladies Golf Club (adjacent, founded 1896) is a separate and equally prestigious club with its own course and a more accessible visitor policy.",

The course has a raw, unmanicured quality that purists love — the rough is genuine rough, the greens are fast and true, and the wind off the Irish Sea is ever-present. It lacks the manicured polish of Royal Birkdale but delivers a more authentic, elemental links experience at a considerably more accessible green fee.\n\nThe club has a long history with Open Championship qualifying. If you want to play a genuinely historic and challenging links without the premium price tag, West Lancashire is a strong choice.",

The history alone makes it worth a round, but the course earns its reputation on its own merits too.\n\nS&A sits between Hillside and Formby and shares the coastal dune terrain that characterises the best of the Sefton Coast. The first few holes are relatively benign, which gives visitors a false sense of security — the course stiffens considerably through the middle section, with several holes genuinely exposed to the prevailing westerly.\n\nGreen fees are among the most accessible on the coast for what is genuinely a historic and challenging links. For visitors putting together a multi-day trip, S&A pairs well with either Hillside or West Lancashire for a strong two-day itinerary at reasonable cost.",

The course is shorter than its Sefton Coast neighbours but plays longer than the card in a coastal breeze, and the bunkering is thoughtfully placed to reward proper links shot-making.\n\nFor visitors building a high-volume trip — four or five rounds — Old Links provides welcome relief on the wallet while still delivering authentic links golf. It's also the most welcoming to visitors without handicap certificates, making it the natural choice for higher-handicappers or casual players.",
